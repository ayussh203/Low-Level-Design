# Class

A class is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions. It represents the blueprint of the object. Class is the only logical representation of the data.

For example, a Human being is a class. The body parts of a human being are its properties, and the actions performed by the body parts are known as functions. The class does not occupy any memory space till the time an object is instantiated.

# Object

An object is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class. An object can represent a person, place or any other item. An object can operate on both data members and member functions.

To create an object, you use the new keyword followed by the class constructor. The new keyword is used to create an object, which allocates memory for it.
