# What is Aggregation?

## Definition
Aggregation is a specialized form of association where one object (the aggregate) contains or refers to other objects (the components), but those components can exist on their own.

**Key point:** If the aggregate is destroyed, the component objects can still exist elsewhere.

## Key Characteristics of Aggregation:
- Represents a has-a relationship.
- The contained object can exist independently of the container.
- Implemented using references (pointers) to objects.
- Promotes loose coupling between objects.

## Real-world Analogy

### Library and Book
A library has books. If the library closes (is destroyed), the books still exist and could move to another library.

### Team and Player
A sports team has players, but a player can transfer to another team and still exist independently.

### When to Use Aggregation?

When an object can exist independently from the container.
When designing loosely coupled systems.
When different objects need to be shared across multiple containers.
When following SOLID principles, particularly the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
