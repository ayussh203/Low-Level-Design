 Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
 Compile-time polymorphism occurs when multiple methods in the same class share the same name but have different method signatures (parameters). The method to be called is determined at compile time.

 Why Use Method Overloading?

Provides a cleaner and more intuitive interface.
Reduces redundancy by using a single method name for similar operations.
