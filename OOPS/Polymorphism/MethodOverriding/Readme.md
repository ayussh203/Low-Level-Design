 Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
Run-time polymorphism occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. The method to be called is determined at runtime.

Why Use Method Overriding?

Enables dynamic method resolution.
Supports polymorphic behavior, where one interface can be used for multiple implementations.
Makes code extensible by allowing future modifications.
