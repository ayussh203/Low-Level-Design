# Polymorphism in Java

## Introduction
Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a single interface to be used for different types of objects, enabling flexibility, scalability, and code reuse.

Polymorphism in Java can be classified into two types:

- Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
- Run-time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

## What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows a method, function, or object to behave differently based on the context. Polymorphism enables dynamic method resolution and method flexibility, making applications easier to extend and maintain.

## Key Benefits of Polymorphism
- **Code Reusability:** Write a single interface that works for multiple types.
- **Scalability:** Add new functionalities with minimal code changes.
- **Maintainability:** Reduce complexity and improve code clarity.
